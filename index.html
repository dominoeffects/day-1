    <h2> Challenges in Class</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            I have trouble talking with people even if I need help but I also didn't want to fall behind so I just asked for help when I needed it so I could keep up. 
        </li>
        <li> 
            I do not always understand the commands being used in terminal but I make sure to take it slow & take notes and screen shots of the process to reference lateron after class so I don't have to rely on memory and good internet searches. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I have trouble maintaining my energy once we reached topics I was famililar with so I made myself do little extra stuff to keep myself alert.
